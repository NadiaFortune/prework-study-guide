 # Bootcamp prework guide

## Description

This guide was created to provide a very basic info page to new bootcamp students about what they would be studying throughout the course.

It served as a first step in the prework required prior to starting the course and we a required element before the course began.

It produced an easy-to-read one page simple and basic web page incorporating the use of basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding.

It was very useful and gave an insight into what I would be learning in my new journey in becoming a front end developer.
